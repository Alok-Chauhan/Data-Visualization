The problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue.
If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. 

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation.

This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts generally handle.
There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

Request id: A unique identifier of the request
Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available

Note: For the sake of simplicity, only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.
